        <h1>My Passion: Building PCs</h1>
        <p>I have a passion for Building an Customizing PCs. I was introduced to it by the age of 12 when I learned about Alienware Gaming PCs and other brands. And  that it was better than if you built your own from scratch. This may sound funny but I can’t exactly pinpoint what inspired me to do this, but I can say I wanted to expand outside playing on consoles and try something new. Now I may have found an inspiration for PCs through the insane case mods people have created! It could be of an existing case or one that’s been homemade!</p>

					<li> When building a PC it's possible to even make your OWN case!, even out of something that isn't a PC, I.e a carboard box, or game console. </li>
					
					<li>You can play almost any game online free, and/or have it as a workstation, it's all up to you</li>
